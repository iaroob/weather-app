# React Weather App

This is a simple weather application built with React that allows users to search for weather information of different locations based on city and country.

## Features

- Search for weather information by entering a city and country
- Display current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on different devices

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data for the app
- Bootstrap: CSS framework for styling the app

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/iaroob/weather-app.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ``` cd react-weather-app

3. Install the dependencies:
    ``` npm install
    
4. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up on their website (https://openweathermap.org) and create a .env file in the project root directory. Add the following line to the .env file:
    ``` API_KEY=your-api-key
    
5. Start the development server:
    ``` npm start
    
6. Open the app in your browser:
   ``` http://localhost:3000

## Usage
- Enter a city and country in the input fields provided.
- Click the "Submit" button to view the weather information for the specified location.
- The app will display the current weather conditions for the selected location.
- Enjoy exploring the weather information for different locations!

## Acknowledgments
- ** OpenWeatherMap ** for providing the weather data and API.
- ** Bootstrap ** for the CSS framework


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
